    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I remember the first time I tried tofu. It was raw in a whole grain wrap along with some mustard and veggies and
        I honestly couldn’t finish it. And when it comes to food I’m a trooper. I’ll finish just about anything as I
        hate wasting food. But, tofu did not strike my fancy from the start and it’s never really been my favorite, even
        in my hardcore vegetarian days.

        But, that all changed recently during a trip to San Antonio when I ate the best tofu of my life. It was in a
        veggie stir-fry over coconut brown rice at a restaurant called Green Vegetarian Cuisine. If you’re ever in the
        area you must stop by and try this dish. Your view of tofu will be forever changed – promise.

        <br>
        Two bites in and I was in heaven. I had to flag the waitress down and ask her how in the world they made the
        tofu taste so good! I thought it was fried, but it wasn’t. Haaaa-llelujah.

        The best part? It wasn’t wet or soft or soggy or lacking in flavor at all like all of the tofu I’d tried prior.
        She rattled off a few instructions and I made a mental note. That same week I hopped in the kitchen and gave it
        a go myself.

        It really worked you guys! I love tofu now. It might not be as delicious as Green Vegetarian Cuisine’s version,
        but it’s very close. And the more I practice the better I’ll get. I have a very good feeling about this.

        The basic trick is first drying the tofu, then baking it at a high temperature to brown it and create a tougher
        texture, and then letting it set out to dry even more. This gives it a “meat-like” texture, if you will, that
        makes
        it much more porous to soak up delicious sauces and far more appetizing in the texture department. With this
        tofu I
        can’t help but finish it all – it’s too delicious not to!

        Cooking our Easy Tofu Stir-Fry recipe in a skillet
        For this recipe I made a quick and simple stir-fry* but once you have the basics down this tofu could be used in
        just about any recipe you already love. It works extremely well in stir fries because they tend to be very
        saucy,
        but I also imagine it would be delicious over salad, in faux-egg salads and even with BBQ sauce.

        I hope to incorporate it into more of the meals we regularly prepare to see just how versatile it is. But from
        what I’ve tasted so far, I have very high hopes.

    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and begin drying your tofu. Drain, remove it from the package and
            place between two thick towels folded into the shape of the tofu. Then place a plate or bowl on top and top
            it with something heavy like a book or skillet. Alternatively, use a <a

                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tofu press</a>.</li>
        <li>
            Let it dry for about 15 minutes, changing your towels if they get too wet. Once dry, unwrap, chop tofu into
            roughly 1-inch cubes or rectangles</li>
        <li>Arrange tofu on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet to prevent sticking and bake for a total
            of 25-35 minutes, flipping once halfway through to ensure even cooking. This will dry out the tofu and help
            give it a more meat-like texture. If you want a tougher texture, cook it for 30-35. For a slightly more
            tender texture, pull it out at 20-25 minutes to check.</li>
        <li>
            Once it’s golden brown and a bit tough and firm, remove from the oven set it out to dry a bit more while you
            prep your vegetables. Ideally, it would set out another 45 minutes or even longer. I haven’t tried letting
            it set out for much longer, but I don’t think it would hurt either way.
        </li>
        <li>If serving over rice, start the rice at this point.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together all of the sauce ingredients – set aside.</li>
        <li>To a large skillet over medium-high heat, add sesame oil and swirl to coat. Then add veggies and toss to
            coat. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring often. When the vegetables have some color and have softened a bit, add
            the sauce and stir. It should bubble and thicken. Then add the tofu and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. When veggies are cooked to your preferred doneness, remove
            from heat. Serve as is or over rice for a more filling meal. Best when eaten fresh, though will keep in the
            refrigerator for a couple days.</li>
    </ol>
