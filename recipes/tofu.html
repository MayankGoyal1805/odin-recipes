    <h2>Description</h2>
    Tofu is also known as soy paneer or bean curd. It is made by coagulating soy milk and then pressing it into tofu
    moulds to create a block of soy paneer. Soy beans are soaked over night, ground to a fine puree, strained in a
    cheese cloth to extract soy milk. The soy milk is then cooked and curdled | coagulated with lemon juice, vinegar or
    nigiri flakes (traditional coagulant). <br>

    Nutritionally, Tofu is low in calories and high in protein. It is also high in iron, calcium and magnesium. Tofu is
    the preferred protein source for vegetarians, vegans. <br>

    There are many types of tofu prepared depending on the coagulant and pressing time. Silken tofu is soft and silky
    tofu which is often used in soups and desserts. Firm, extra firm tofu is the popular tofu used more widely. One of
    the most popular recipe using tofu is <a href="https://www.yummytummyaarthi.com/mapo-tofu/" target="_blank"

            Try to use organic soy beans for making tofu. Good quality beans is necessary. You have to soak the soy
            beans for atleast 10 hours or overnight which makes the grinding process easier. Sometimes when making tofu

    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Soaking Soy Beans</h3>
            Take soy beans a bowl. Rinse it really well. Add lots of water over it and let let it soak overnight (around
            10 hours). Once the beans are soaked. Drain and rinse in cold water to remove any smell from the beans.

        <li>
            <h3>Grinding Soy Beans</h3>
            Take the rinsed drained beans in a blender, Add 2 litre water to it and puree till smooth. You might need to
            do it in 2 batches.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Extracting Soy Milk from Soy beans</h3>
                Now take a large nonstick pot in which you are going to cook the soy milk. Place a colander on top.
                Place nut milk bag over the colander. Pour the ground soy beans mixture into the nut milk and gently
                squeeze to remove as much soy milk as possible. You have to keep on squeezing the bag to get the soy
                milk. Take your time in this step and make sure you get as much soy milk as possible.
                <br>
                Once the milk is extracted, the product left in the nut milk bag is called as soy bean pulp or okara.
                You can make lots of recipes using it. Check my notes section for ideas.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Cooking Soy Milk</h3>
            Now place the large pot of soy milk on heat. Use a silicon or wooden spatula to keep on stiring the pot
            since the soy milk has tendency to stick at the bottom. Bring the soy milk to a boil, Keep on mixing since
            soy milk will boil over. Also you might be seeing some scum forming on top of soy milk, you can remove it
            using a spoon.
            <br>
            Now once the soy milk has started to boil, reduce the flame and cook for 15 mins on low heat, keep stirring
            all the time. Once 15 mins is over, your soy milk is done. If you are planning to serve it as soy milk, you
            might want to stop at this point. You can add honey and vanilla extract to soy milk and enjoy.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Coagulating Soy Milk</h3>
            But to make tofu. In a bowl mix lemon juice with Â½ cup of water. This is your curdling ingredients for
            making tofu. Place the soy milk back on heat, once it starts to heat up, add in the lemon juice and mix
            gently. You will see the soy milk starts to curdle instantly.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Pressing Tofu</h3>
            Now take a baking tray, place a wire rack on top. Now place your tofu press on top. Line your tofu press
            with muslin or cheese cloth. Spoon the curdled soy milk over the tofu press. Once u transferred curdled milk
            on the mould. Cover it over gently with the cheesecloth. Place the tofu press lid and weigh it with any
            heavy object. I like to use my mortar and pestle. Leave the tofu to drain for at least 1 to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Serving</h3>
            Gently remove the tofu from the mould and unwrap. Slice and use as required. You will be getting around 400
            to 500 grams or tofu from this recipe.
