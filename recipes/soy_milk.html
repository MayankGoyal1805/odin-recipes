    <h2>Description</h2>
    Homemade soy milk is a natural, plant-based drink made from soybeans. It's an excellent dairy-free alternative rich
    in protein and can be enjoyed on its own or added to coffee, smoothies, or recipes. To make it, you soak soybeans
    overnight, blend them with water, and strain the mixture to separate the soy pulp (okara) from the liquid. The
    resulting soy milk is creamy, mildly sweet, and can be flavored with a hint of vanilla or sweeteners like sugar or
    maple syrup, depending on preference. This homemade version is fresh, preservative-free, and customizable to suit
    your taste.</p>

    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and Soak dried soy beans overnight in lots of water. Drain it and add it to a blender.</li>
        <li>Puree them with ½ cup of water to a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Now line a cheesecloth over a sauce pan. Pour the pureed mixture over this and squeeze lightly to remove the
            milk from it.</li>
        <li>Now you can add ½ cup more water to the squeezed mix and squeeze again to remove as much milk as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Keep doing this two more time by adding ½ cup of water each time. As a total you must have added 2 cups of
            water.
        </li>
        <li>Now place saucepan on heat and bring it to boil. Use a ladle to spoon all the scum which forms on the top of
            the milk.</li>
        <li>Keep doing this every now and then.</li>
        <li>Simmer the pan and cook it for 25 to 30 mins.
        </li>
        <li>Now strain this milk using a fine sieve. Allow it to cool down.
        </li>
        <li>Once it is cooled add in sugar and vanilla as per your taste.
        </li>
        <li>Chill it and serve.
        </li>
